### Introduction to Packages

There are two main Python packages that can be used to get elevation data. They are called "elevation" and "pyhigh". To demonstrate how to use each one I will be working with a dataset of Chipotle locations which can be downloaded [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jeffreybraun/chipotle-locations).{% endraw %}. Once downloaded, read in your data using pandas and safe it as a df. I named mine "chiptle_df".
