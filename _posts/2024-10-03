### Introduction to Pyhigh

Pyhigh is a package in Python that is used to access elevation data that was created by "sgherbst" on github. This package relies on caching to avoid unecessary downloads.

### Getting Started

 To demonstrate how to use each one I will be working with a dataset of Chipotle locations which can be downloaded [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jeffreybraun/chipotle-locations).{% endraw %}. I am specifically insterested in Utah locations so after reading in my Chipotle data I will filter my data to only include Utah rows. This can be done as shown below:
```
import pandas as pd

# Load your dataset
chipotle_df = pd.read_csv('C:\\Documents\\pythonProject\\blog_tutorial\\chipotle_locations')
# Filter chipotle data to only include Utah
utah_df = chipotle_df[chipotle_df['state'] == 'Utah']

# View your new df
print(utah_df.head())

```
