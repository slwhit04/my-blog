<blockquote> Dogs are a man's best friend, however, we usually outlive our furry friends. There is not much we can do to increase their lifespan, however, the type of dog or size of dog may help determine how long they live. </blockquote>
  
  
<blockquote> I love dogs and have always been interested in them and I’ve heard that larger dogs don’t live as long as smaller dogs due to health complications of their heart not being able to pump blood all through their body, as well as other issues. I decided to combine two of my interests, dogs and statstics, to determine if a dog’s size effects its life expectancy.</a>  </blockquote>
