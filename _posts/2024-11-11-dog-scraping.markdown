<blockquote> Dogs are a man's best friend, however, we usually outlive our furry friends. There is not much we can do to increase their lifespan, however, the type of dog or size of dog may help determine how long they live. </blockquote>
  
  
<blockquote> I love dogs and have always been interested in them and I’ve heard that larger dogs don’t live as long as smaller dogs due to health complications of their heart not being able to pump blood all through their body, as well as other issues. I decided to combine two of my interests, dogs and statstics, to determine if a dog’s size effects its life expectancy.</a>  </blockquote>

  

## How I got Started

To collect my dog data, I scraped all the dogs, aswell as their breed info, from the [American Kennel Club official website]([https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/selenium-python-tutorial/)) To ensure ethical scraping practices, I first checked the website's robots.txt file which includes the website's policy on scraping data.

Explain that I used selenium and how to use it

1. List Item
2. Longer List Item
    1. Nested OL Item
    2. Another thing

Example of how I set up Selenium WebDriver
{%- highlight python -%}
pass
{%- endhighlight -%}


## Cleaning

Some general concepts of cleaning data. Explain what I used specifically and why.

{%- highlight python -%}
pass
{%- endhighlight -%}

## The Results

Summary statistics, summary graphics, and information about final dataset (e.g., total sample size, counts of categorical variables, numerical summaries of numeric variables)
